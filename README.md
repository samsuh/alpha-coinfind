# CoinFind.io
This is an initial implementation of the CoinFind.io site. The gist of this is to have a site where the aggregation of community attention is focused to keep information on the site more updated than can practically be optimized for. More activity on the site will force re-renders to the site to happen more frequently, so many people visiting the /bitcoin endpoint of the site to check for updated bitcoin info would be more actively refreshed than a site with low visits. The aim of this project is to give end users the most updated information possible for a reasonable investment of time/money/engagement, and to do so in a neutral and blockchain-agnostic manner. Ideally, people would come here to get better quality relevant information and be empowered to make better trade decisions. 

## Scope
- Implement core workflow
  - Intake information source programmatically
  - Process using AI workflow
  - Output processed workflow
  - Publish output
- Leave these later goals until after core workflow, dont get distracted.
  - optimization
  - multiple sources in
  - improve processing
  - improve output ui
  - improve user experience, make it interesting
  - users, auth
  - wallets/economics

## Ideation
### Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)
CoinFind.io is a blockchain-native automation site integrating AI workflow agents to help traders identify opportuities and make better informed decisions. This decentralized network streamlines data analysis, optimizes recommended resource allocation, and coordinates human expertise and attention. Intelligent agents assist with research, simulations, and decision-making, while humans ultimately pull the trigger to decide which potential future they want to believe in. 

### Fundraising Pitch (1-2 Minutes)
We are building a decentralized, AI-enabled problem-solving network where intelligent workflow agents automate research, optimize decision-making, and coordinate human expertise to address global opportunities. Our system integrates:
 1. AI-driven workflow automation to streamline problem discovery, data analysis, and solution modeling.
 2. Autonomous agents that assist with research, simulations, and portfolio management.
 3. "Collectives" can use blockchain-powered governance to ensure fair decision-making, funding allocation, and ensuring transparency for collective action.

Here's how it works: Our system automates the entire problem-solving pipeline—from detecting urgent trade opportunities (market driven, liquidity driven, chart trends) and matching your personal investor profile into a recommended action (a trade, or joining an existing collective for this short term trade) with supporting rationale. You can also request feedback from community members, propose potential actions for hypothetical market scenarios that go into effect based on triggers, and workflow agents will assist with execution while logging their activity for later review and the rationale tree that led to their decisions, which can be later mined for successful patterns of activity.

With funding, we will scale our automation infrastructure, expand our decentralized expert network, and refine governance models to make high-impact decision-making more efficient, secure, and accessible. This is a significant advancement in collective intelligence—where automation, integrating the best from AI agents and human ingenuity combined to solve problems at scale.
