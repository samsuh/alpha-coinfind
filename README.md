# CoinFind.io
This is an initial implementation of the CoinFind.io site. The gist of this is to have a site where the aggregation of community attention is focused to keep information on the site more updated than can practically be optimized for. More activity on the site will force re-renders to the site to happen more frequently, so many people visiting the /bitcoin endpoint of the site to check for updated bitcoin info would be more actively refreshed than a site with low visits. The aim of this project is to give end users the most updated information possible for a reasonable investment of time/money/engagement, and to do so in a neutral and blockchain-agnostic manner. Ideally, people would come here to get better quality relevant information and be empowered to make better trade decisions. 

## Scope
- Implement core workflow
  - Intake information source programmatically
  - Process using AI workflow
  - Output processed workflow
  - Publish output
- Leave these later goals until after core workflow, dont get distracted.
  - optimization
  - multiple sources in
  - improve processing
  - improve output ui
  - improve user experience, make it interesting
  - users, auth
  - wallets/economics

## Ideation
Note: this was thought through beforehand, but organized/formated through chatgpt to distill unstructured information from multiple sources. 
### Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)
Imagine a world where blockchain-powered automation and AI-driven workflow agents help humans collaborate seamlessly to solve global challenges. Our decentralized network leverages AI-enabled workflow automation to streamline data analysis, optimize resource allocation, and coordinate human expertise. Intelligent agents assist with research, simulations, and decision-making, while blockchain ensures transparency and fair governance through smart contracts. Together, we drive impact in industries like healthcare, climate change, and researchâ€”making problem-solving faster, fairer, and more scalable.
### Fundraising Pitch (1-2 Minutes)
We are building a decentralized, AI-enabled problem-solving network where intelligent workflow agents automate research, optimize decision-making, and coordinate human expertise to address global challenges. Our system integrates:
 âœ… AI-driven workflow automation to streamline problem discovery, data analysis, and solution modeling.
 âœ… Autonomous agents that assist with research, simulations, and project management.
 âœ… Blockchain-powered governance to ensure fair decision-making, funding allocation, and transparency.
Here's how it works: Our system automates the entire problem-solving pipelineâ€”from detecting urgent global challenges to optimizing funding distribution through smart contracts. Community members propose solutions, workflow agents assist with execution, and blockchain ensures accountability.
With funding, we will scale our automation infrastructure, expand our decentralized expert network, and refine governance models to make high-impact decision-making more efficient, secure, and accessible. This is the future of collective intelligenceâ€”where automation, AI agents, and human ingenuity combine to solve problems at scale. Letâ€™s build it together. ðŸš€
